# Text2Brain Web Server
![brain interpreter preview](./figures/brain_interpreter.gif)

A webpage that deploys [Text2Brain](https://github.com/ngohgia/text2brain) model for predicting brain activation maps from free-form text query.
The webpage is built with Flask + Google Cloud Functions.
More details about the implementation can be found at [https://ngohgia.github.io/ml-web](https://ngohgia.github.io/ml-web).

Another bootstrapped version of the webserver using Flask + SQLite + AngularJS + Redis + RQ (without the Google Cloud Functions) can be found on the [bootstrapped-server](https://github.com/ngohgia/text2brain_server/tree/bootstrapped-server) branch.
We would like to thank [nilearn](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn) library for the code to render the brain surface visualization.
